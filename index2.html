            <p>The following questions will determine if I'm the kind of front-end developer you are looking for. There will be a
                grade at the end telling you how likely I am to enjoy working for your company. This quiz was built as a way for me to
                implement new knowledge of JavaScript's language, libraries, frameworks, and any features of HTML5 or CSS3 I can
                add without making the design look like I wiped mud on your screen. If you're score is high enough, perhaps you'd
                like to check out my source code? Perhaps you want to hire me? Either way, thanks for stopping by. Enjoy!
